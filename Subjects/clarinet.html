          <h4>History</h4>
          <p>The clarinet was invented in 1690 by Johann Christoph Denner and just like the saxophone, it uses a reed to make a sound. He based his instrument on an earlier instrument called the chalumeau. Since then, minor changes have been made to improve playability.</p>
          <p>The clarinet is classed a member of the woodwind section of a classical orchestra, but is also used in big-band jazz and even some rock music!</p>
          <p>Clarinets come in three main keys and each have their place in an orchestra. </p>

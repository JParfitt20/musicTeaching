        <div class="history">
          <h4>History</h4>
          <p>The piano as we know it was first created in the early 1700s but was around in various forms before that. Probably the most well known pre-curser to the Piano is the Harpsichord, although there are many more.</p>
          <p>The man who invented the first Piano was called Bartolemeo di Francesco Crsitofori and he was a maker of Harpsichords. He made the piano so that it could play loud and soft, which other keyboard instruments couldn't do.</p>
          <p>The Piano contains lots of steel strings that are strung very tightly. Whenever you press a key to play a note, a hammer strikes a string and this sounds the note. The thicker the string, the lower the note!</p>
          <p>Because of the way the sound is made, the Piano is actually classed as a percussion instrument! It's often found in the percussion section of orchestras.</p>
          <p>The piano can be played as a solo instrument, to accompany another instrument or as part of a larger orchestra.</p>

        <div class="famous-players">
          <h4>Famous players</h4>
          <p>There are many famous names associated with the piano, both from the past and still around today. There are too many to mention them all here so I definitely reccomend spending some time on YouTube and listening to many different pianists.</p>
          <p>Perhaps one of the most talked about pianists around today is Lang Lang. He has played with many orchestras all over the world. You can check out some of his performances and other work <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/user/langlang" target = "_blank">here</a>.</p>
          <p>Famous pianists from the past include Franz Liszt, Sergei Rachmaninoff and Vladimir Horowitz. But as I said before, these names are just the tip of the iceberg and there are definitely a lot more out there!</p>

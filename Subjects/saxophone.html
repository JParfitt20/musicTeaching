          <h4>History</h4>
          <p>Although the saxophone is often associated with jazz or pop music, it does in fact have a place in a classical orchestra. There are at least 6 different kinds and sizes of saxophone but the most popular and well recognised is the alto saxophone.</p>
          <p>The saxophone was invented in 1840 by Adolphe Sax. It was designed to be like a cross between a brass instrument and a woodwind instrument, although it is classed as a woodwind instrument. Just like the clarinet, the saxophone uses a reed to make the sound and a key mechanism to cover the holes.</p>

        <div class="famous-players">
          <h4>Famous players</h4>
          <p>Many of the better known saxophonists are jazz musicians such as Ben Webster or John Coltrane who is considered one of the most influential jazz saxophonists from the 1950s-1960s. </p>
        </p> However, this doesn't mean that the saxophone doens't have a place in more classical music, as Jess Gillam proved by becoming the first person to reach the final of BBC young musician of the year playing the Saxophone.</p>

          <h4>History</h4>
          <p>The first flute was originally made from wood and because of this, it is a member of what we call the Woodwind family.</p>
              <p>The first wooden flute was made around 1320 and didn't have keys - just holes in the flute. It went through many changes, and the flute as we know it today wasn't built until 1878 by Theobald Boehm.</p>
              <p>Yout may not know that there is actually more than one size of flute. THere is a smaller sized flute called the piccolo which has a higher sound than the normal flute. There is also an alto flute which is slightly bigger and lower in pitch. There is even a bass flute which has to bend so the flautist can reach the keys!</p>
          <p>The flute is a popular instrument in the Woodwind section of an orchestra alongside other isntruments such as the clarinet, saxophone or oboe. THe flute can be used as part of the overall sound, or as a solo intrument.</p>

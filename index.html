          <p>Hi! My name's Joanna and I've been teaching music since 2016. I teach piano and woodwind (flute, clarinet and saxophone). I'm a fully trained teacher with QTS and I have several diplomas in music. I have three diplomas on the piano and one on the flute. </p>
          <p>I live just outside Norwich in the Norfolk countryside. Most of my time is spent going into local schools to teach pupils but I also teach pupils of all ages at home. </p>
          <p>To find out more about what I teach, visit the &apos;Subjects&apos; page. </p>

          <h3>About lessons</h3>
          <p>Lessons are usually 30 minutes long, although for younger beginners I do recommend starting with 20 minute lessons until they are more confident. My current rate is Â£30/hour or pro rata for part of an hour.</p>
          <p>Within each lesson I try to include music theory as well as the practical elements of music. First lessons also include information on instrument care and how to assemble/disassemble their chosen instrumnet. </p>
          <p>I teach using a combination of tutor books and games, using both apps and resources such as cards. </p>
